## Purpose

Search Queue adds a queue to Google search! This extension allows the user to queue up multiple searches and quickly make them. It was designed with market analysis in mind, however it has many use cases. In general, it's a great tool for anyone who has to make many successive Google searches and would like to speed up the process.

## Funcionality

Search Queue has a few different features, all of which I will attempt to explain in detail here.

### Extension Popup

The extension popup page can be accessed by clicking the Search Queue icon on the right of the toolbar. On this page, there are few tasks that the user can do:

## Use Cases

In general, Search Queue is a great for anyone who needs to make many Google searches. A few specific examples of how it might be used are as follows:

#### 1. Analysis

If an analyst has a large number of Google searches that need to be made about a particular topic (e.g. business, product, software), Search Queue is helpful in making these searches in a quick, organized way.

#### 2. Research

If a researcher has a topic of interest with many different facets and would like to learn about each of these facets, Search Queue is helpful in effeciently generating searches for each facet relating to the topic of interest.

#### 3. Spreadsheet Work

If a user is doing work which involves making Google searches from a spreadsheet, instead of switching between the spreadsheet and Google for each search, the user can simply copy and paste the list of searches into Search Queue.
